Artemis Financial is a financial services company that provides financial planning and insurance solution
to clients around the world. The issue they wanted me to address was secure storage of private data
and secure communications to upload and download data.
I am not sure that I was able to secure anything that they wanted done, but I feel that I did the
dependency checks well as well as the suppression of some of the vulnerabilities. Coding securely is
important because there are threats everywhere. In some instances, other companies even want to
steal your data to help their business gain advantages. Secure coding practices can help minimize
compromise and vulnerabilities that may arise when the application is implemented. The overall
wellbeing of a company is improved with secure software because it increases trust in the company and
decreases the chances of seeing the company on the news with some major data leak, which has
become so common these days.
I found most of the final project for Artemis Financial difficult and challenging and could only accomplish
small tasks with the help of tutors from SNHU. I probably should have had some programming tutors
help walk me through what I was doing wrong. After trying to do one task I still attempted to move on
to the next and I do not think it helped with the whole process. The tutors were helpful when working
with small parts, but I think that I needed a lot more help that that. I will continue to study and get help
from other programmers as this class may be the field that I go into in the future.
I approached the need to increase security by first running the dependency checks. Then I analyzed the
source code to make sure that there were no errors. After that, I tried to implement TLS and my AES
encryption. In the real world I would go at a project in a similar way. Making sure that each step of the
way everything is done correctly. I feel I understand what needs to be done, but the small things I was
unable to accomplish.
I think that I figured out how to generate certificates to make client/server transactions were safe and
secure. Maven is also a tool that I think will be very beneficial to secure coding. When I figured out how
to implement it as part of the IDE being used it proved very beneficial.
What I could show employers for the future is my ability to conduct a dependency check, through
eclipse. I felt by the second project I knew what I was doing and able to conduct a test with no help from
outside sources, or the tutorials on bright space.
